    Nature is the intricate, beautiful physical world and living systems around us—from mountains, oceans, and forests to the air, water, plants, and animals—providing essential resources, balance, and inspiration, while also requiring human protection from pollution and destruction to sustain life. It's the realm of everything not made by humans, where interconnected ecosystems thrive and offer peace, but which faces threats from human activities, emphasizing our responsibility to conserve it.
Key aspects of nature:
The Physical World: Includes landscapes, weather, geology, and cosmic phenomena.
Life & Ecosystems: Encompasses all living beings (plants, animals, humans) and their interdependence, maintaining vital balance.
Resources & Sustenance: Provides clean air, water, food, and shelter necessary for survival.
Beauty & Inspiration: A source of joy, peace, and creativity, teaching patience and respect.
Vulnerability: Threatened by human actions like pollution and deforestation, making conservation vital.
